### Hear From Early Users

<div class="testimonial-box">
    <strong>Andrew Noble, PhD, Director of Data Science at a Fortune-500 Healthcare Company</strong>: "Right now, every Healthcare data company is racing for a GenAI Copilot that will enable their Data Engineers to build Data Products 50% faster.  Off-the-shelf Copilots are useless because they are not specialized to the Healthcare company’s proprietary database design and would not comply with security standards.  HomeMadeAI’s iQuery is the first end-to-end solution - launched by an industry expert with a deep, granular understanding of Healthcare data and how to accelerate Healthcare Data Engineering workflows."
