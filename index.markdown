# Welcome to HomemadeAI

## Our Mission

In an era where artificial intelligence models, such as large language models, are becoming increasingly general and capable, a new challenge emerges for businesses looking to harness this power: operational and infrastructural barriers. At HomeMadeAI, we believe that as AI becomes more general, it must also become more specialized. It's akin to a person who has mastered languages, basic math, and logic but has yet to specialize in a specific field.

Our mission is to "make AI homemade." We strive to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technologies, making them easily adaptable for specific business use cases. By breaking down the barriers to AI implementation, we empower businesses to leverage AI's full potential, ensuring that the benefits of AI are not just general but specially tailored to meet the unique needs of each enterprise.
